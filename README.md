We use three check-in datasets, including two Foursquare datasets[1](https://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f807a403e33d2ea431279f900d0eed8&site=xueshu_se) and one Gowalla dataset[2](https://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7daff7e2c242f88203db334e0c66b135&site=xueshu_se).Specifically, the two Foursquare user check-in datasets contain the check-in records of users in New York (NY) and Tokyo (TKY) from April 2012 to February 2013 on the Foursquare website.The Gowalla dataset contains the check-in records of users on the Gowalla website from February 2009 to October 2010.
